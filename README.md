# The Nexus
A machine that sorts LEGO®

Everything here is currently a huge work in progress. I hope to have minimum functionality implemented by the end of March.

## Goals and "Plan"
### Key features
- Take in an arbitrary pile of pieces ranging in size from 1x1 studs to 8x8 plates
- Identify all known LEGO® pieces as precisely what they are, BrickLink ID and color
- Sort the pieces into practically infinite categories, let number of bins be extensible by adding more "distribution modules"
    - Current architecture supports expanding to over 900 bins
- Sort pieces according to pleasant-to-setup user-defined "profiles"
- Reproducible
    - Primarily constructed from aluminum extrusion, 3D printed parts, and affordable, easily acquireable motors/electronics

### Pipe dreams
- Reliable
- Rate >~1 piece/second
- Low noise
- Put entire host system on a smartphone
    - Good GPU, CPU, memory, camera, LED, UI, and reliability package per dollar
