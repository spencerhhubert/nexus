## LDraw's File Naming Conventions for Parts (as it appears)
### File name contains:
+ p = pattern or print
+ s = serial, followed by a number, indicates a version of that piece with a print. s1, s2, s3 in various file names that are otherwise the same would indicate the same piece with different prints
+ a, b, c = versions of the same piece. given two files with equal numbers followed by a and b respectively, they would represent slightly different molds of the same piece
+ t (prefix) = train related parts
+ u (prefix) = random stuff, Fabuland, Mursten
